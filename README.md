Alternatively, if you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your computer, you can create a conda Python environment to configure the environment.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate gee
```

4. After configuring the environment, run this command to start Jupyter Lab:
```
jupyter lab
```

5. Finally, you can execute Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) in the working directory, here is a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5YyoCKxEOU).
